# activitybot-bluetooth-controller
This is a controller I wrote for my Parallax Activitybot to allow it to be controlled over bluetooth from a web page connected through a NodeJS app. 

## How it works
The Activitybot has the RN-42 bluetooth interface.  The NodeJS app uses Eelco's [node-bluetooth-serial-port (https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-bluetooth-serial-port)] NodeJS module to connect to the robot. It also uses Alaa-eddine K's [eureca.io (http://eureca.io/)] to handle communication between the NodeJS App and the web page.

## Requirements
* [ActivityBot (https://www.parallax.com/product/32500)]
* [RN-42 Bluetooth Module (https://www.parallax.com/product/30086)]
* Computer with bluetooth that can run NodeJS
 
## Installation
* TODO
